# Unhandled AsyncStorage Errors in React Native

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native development involving AsyncStorage and its solution.

## Problem

When using AsyncStorage, failing to include proper error handling using `try...catch` blocks can mask critical issues, hindering debugging efforts.  The code may appear to function normally but data might not be saved.

## Solution

Always wrap your AsyncStorage operations within `try...catch` blocks to handle potential errors gracefully and log them for troubleshooting.  This makes your application more robust and easier to debug.
